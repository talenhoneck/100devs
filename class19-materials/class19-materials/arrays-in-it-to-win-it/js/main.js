//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movies = ('star wars','irobot', 'shrek')
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let firstMovie= movies[0] 

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let movieLength = movies.length
console.leg(movieLength)

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let lastElement = movies[movies.length - 1]
